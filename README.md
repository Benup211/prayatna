# Django Project with AWS KMS Encryption

## Overview

This Django project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using the Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) for managing keys. In this project, we use KMS to generate and store the keys for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for Initialization Vector (IV) and Data Encryption Key (DEK).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Python and Django installed
- AWS account with access to KMS
- AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials
- AWS Encrypt Credit Card Number
